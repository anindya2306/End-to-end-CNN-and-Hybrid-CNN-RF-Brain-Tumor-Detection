# End-to-end-CNN-and-Hybrid-CNN-RF-Brain-Tumor-Detection
This project employs TensorFlow to develop a CNN-based brain tumor detection system. Moreover, a hybrid model, combining a pre-trained CNN as a feature extractor with a Random Forest Classifier, achieved even better performance, underscoring the efficacy of hybrid approaches in medical image analysis.
